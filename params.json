It is written using swift and is compatible with objective-c. Just drop it to your project and pass images or urls to make the magic happen. Feel free to download the demo and give a try!\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n - Simple to use\r\n - Support Objective-c and swift\r\n - Cache images in memory cache(NSCache) and in file system\r\n - Double tap to zoom in and zoom out\r\n - Single tap to close the image viewer\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n#####1. CocoaPods\r\n(nod ready, coming soon)\r\n#####2. Drop in\r\n**For Swift**\r\n\r\n - Just drop the \"HYLImageGroupViewController\" folder into your project.\r\n\r\n**For Objective-c**\r\n\r\n - Drop the \"HYLImageGroupViewController\" folder into your project. \r\n - Import the swift header file in the .m file which you would like to use this\r\n```objective-c\r\n #import \"YourProjectName-Swift.h\"\r\n```\r\n \r\n### How to use (API)\r\n**Swift:**\r\n```swift\r\nlet myImages:[UIImage]\r\nlet viewController = HYLImageGoupViewController(images:myImages)\r\n//in the view controller\r\nself.presentViewController(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n```\r\nYou can also init it with image urls:\r\n```swift\r\nlet urls:[NSURL]\r\nlet thumbnails:[UIImage]\r\nlet viewContrller = HYLImageGroupViewController(imageURLs: urlGroup, placeHolderImages: thumbnails)\r\n```\r\nOr you can init it with an array of url strings:\r\n```swift\r\nlet urlStrings:[String]\r\n//thumbnail could be nil\r\nlet viewController = HYLImageGroupViewController(imageURLStrings: urlStrings, placeHolderImages: nil)\r\n```\r\nYou can specify the start page after initializing the view controller:\r\n```swift\r\nviewController.currentPage = 2//it will open from the third image\r\n```\r\n**Objective-c**\r\nSame API, just the code style is changed\r\n```objective-c\r\nHYLImageGroupViewController *vc = [[HYLImageGroupViewController alloc] initWithImageURLs:urls placeHolderImages:placeholder];\r\nvc.currentPage = 2\r\n[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\n#What's behind the scene\r\nThe HYLImageViewController only load three images one time: the current image on screen, the image before and the image after.  Everytime user scroll the scroll view, when page changes, it updates the scroll view's subview.\r\n\r\nWhen load images from url, it check the image in the memory cache(NSCache) first, if image is not found, then it check local file system. If the image is not found in cache, it downloads it and save it to local file and cache. It uses image url as the key in the cache storage and uses url's MD5 code as local file name.\r\n# Contact Author\r\n######email: lionhylra@gmail.com\r\n######website: lionhylra.com\r\n\r\n# Support Author?\r\n![WeChat Pay QR code](https://github.com/lionhylra/HYLImageGroupViewController/blob/master/donate.jpg?raw=true)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
